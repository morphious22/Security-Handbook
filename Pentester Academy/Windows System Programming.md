#### Windows Foundations

### Processes and Memory


Processes:
Set of resources used to execute program

Process consists of:

-Virtual address space
-Executable program - code + data
-Table of handles to kernel objects (other shared programs, mutex)
-Security access token
-Threads

Virtual Memory:

Memory is managed in chunks called  "Pages" - default 4KB

Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs):

-DLLs are loadable modules - directly mapped to process address space
-Can contain code, data or resources
-Can be shared between processes


Threads-----------------------------------------

Thread maintains:

-State of CPU registers
-Access mode - user or kernel
-Two stacks - user & kernel
-Optional security token (usually thread uses process's token but sometimes it can have it's own different token)
-Priority
